What is SmartSection ?
======================

SmartSection is a section management module for your XOOPS 2.x site. It is intended to provide the best functionnalities of the News and WF-Section modules. One would have the opportunity to use the module as a news management system, as a section management system, or maybe both ! It is intended to be complete, flexible and yet easy to use.

How to install SmartSection
============================

SmartSection is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy the complete /smartsection folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the SmartFAQ icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
