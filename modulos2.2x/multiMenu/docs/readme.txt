How to install multiMenu
========================

multiMenu is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy the complete /multiMenu folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the multiMenu icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
